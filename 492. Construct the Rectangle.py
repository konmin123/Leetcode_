"""A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a
specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a
rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following
requirements:

The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
target area. The width W should not be larger than the length L,
which means L >= W. The difference between length L and width W should be as
small as possible. Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and
width of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example 1:
Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it
are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,
[4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W
is 2.

Example 2:
Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]

Example 3:
Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]

Constraints:
1 <= area <= 107"""

                output_list.append([area // width, width])
        return min(output_list, key=lambda x: abs(x[0] - x[1]))
