"""An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2,
3, and 5.
Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
Example 1:
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are
limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
Constraints:
-231 <= n <= 231 - 1"""
